# Claude Development Instructions

## Important Git Commit Guidelines

**NEVER** include the following in git commit messages:
- 🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)
- Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
- Any other Claude attribution or emojis

Keep commit messages clean and professional.

## Environment Setup
**ALWAYS** source the `.env` file before running any commands:
```bash
source .env
```

## Build and Development Lifecycle

**ALWAYS** use `make` commands for all build and development tasks. Never run `go` commands directly.

### Common Make Commands

#### Building
- `make build` - Build the binary for current platform
- `make build all` - Build binaries for all platforms

#### Running
- `make run` - Run the application in stdio mode
- `make run http` - Run the application in HTTP/SSE mode
- `make dev` - Run in development mode with hot reload

#### Testing
- `make test` - Run all tests
- `make test-verbose` - Run tests with verbose output
- `make test-coverage` - Run tests with coverage report

#### Code Quality
- `make fmt` - Format code using gofmt
- `make lint` - Run linting checks

#### Docker
- `make docker build` - Build Docker image
- `make docker run` - Run application in Docker
- `make docker run-dev` - Run in Docker development mode
- `make docker stop` - Stop Docker containers
- `make docker clean` - Clean Docker resources

#### Other Commands
- `make clean` - Clean build artifacts
- `make install` - Build and install the binary
- `make deps` - Download and tidy dependencies
- `make health` - Check service health (when running)

## Important Notes

1. **Environment Variables**: The `.env` file contains the `WEBEX_PUBLIC_WORKSPACE_API_KEY` which is required for the application to function. Always ensure it's sourced.

2. **Testing**: When running tests, the environment variable is automatically included in make commands, but if you need to run specific tests, use:
   ```bash
   source .env && make test
   ```

3. **Development Workflow**:
   - Always start with `source .env`
   - Use `make dev` for development with hot reload
   - Use `make fmt` before committing code
   - Use `make lint` to check for issues
   - Use `make test` to ensure all tests pass

4. **Binary Location**: Built binaries are placed in the `build/` directory

5. **Cross-Platform Builds**: Use `make build all` to build for all supported platforms (darwin/amd64, darwin/arm64, linux/amd64, linux/arm64, windows/amd64)

## Manual Testing with MCP Inspector

**IMPORTANT**: Only use MCP Inspector when explicitly requested by the user for debugging or manual testing. For programmatic API calls, use the built binary directly.

For manual testing and debugging MCP tools, use the MCP Inspector:

```bash
source .env && npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector go run .
```

This will:
- Launch the MCP Inspector web interface
- Allow you to manually test individual tools
- See real-time request/response payloads
- Debug tool interactions

The inspector will be available at the URL shown in the terminal output (typically http://localhost:3000).

## Using the Webex MCP Server Programmatically

When users ask for Webex data (rooms, messages, etc.), use the built binary directly:

```bash
# 1. Build the server
make build

# 2. Use the binary with proper MCP protocol
source .env && cat << 'EOF' | ./build/webex-mcp-server 2>/dev/null
{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "initialize", "params": {"protocolVersion": "2024-11-05", "capabilities": {"tools": {"call": {}}}}, "id": 1}
{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "tools/call", "params": {"name": "TOOL_NAME", "arguments": {}}, "id": 2}
EOF
```

Available tools: list_rooms, list_messages, create_a_message, get_my_own_details, list_webhooks, create_a_webhook

## Quick Start for Development

```bash
# 1. Source environment variables
source .env

# 2. Install dependencies
make deps

# 3. Run in development mode
make dev

# 4. In another terminal, run tests
source .env && make test

# 5. Format and lint before committing
make fmt
make lint

# 6. For manual testing with MCP Inspector
source .env && npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector go run .
```

## Debugging

If you encounter issues:
1. Ensure `.env` file exists and is sourced
2. Check that `WEBEX_PUBLIC_WORKSPACE_API_KEY` is set: `echo $WEBEX_PUBLIC_WORKSPACE_API_KEY`
3. Use `make clean` to clean build artifacts and try again
4. For verbose test output: `make test-verbose`

## Never Do

- ❌ Never run `go build` directly - use `make build`
- ❌ Never run `go test` directly - use `make test`
- ❌ Never forget to source `.env` file
- ❌ Never commit without running `make fmt` and `make lint`
